Customers
=========

In OroCommerce terminology, customers are companies who buy your products using OroCommerce front store.

You can assign dedicated sales representatives to support the company purchase process, set specific payment term that matches the payment terms agreement with the company, and label with a tax code that impacts the method of tax calculation in the customer order (e.g. a special tax code should be used for tax-excempt companies, to discard any tax during the chackout). For more information, please see `Managing Customers <customers.html>`_ section. 

When several divisions of a company are using OroCommerce, you can organize them into the two lever organization structure using the limit the parent customer option. Parent company aggregates information from its children, which may be convenient for monitoring and controlling divisions activities. For more information, please see `Managing Customer Hierarchy <customer-hierarchy.html>`_ section. 

Companies may be organized into groups to simpify sharing configuration and price lists, for example among the customers with the same service level. See `Managing Customer Groups <customer-groups.html>`_ for more information.

Company users act on behalf of the company and may have a limited set of permissions in OroCommerce, depending on their function in the customer organization. Yo9u can manage customer users and roles in the OroCommerce administration interface (see `Managing Customer Users <customer-users.html>`_ and `Managing Customer Roles <customer-roles-and-permissions.html>`_ for more information), or yo ucan delegate this function to the customer who will access user and role management in the OroCommmerce front store (see `Delegating Users and Role Management to the Customer <delegating-account-management-to-customers.html>`_ for more information).
