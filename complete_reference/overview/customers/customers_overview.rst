In Customer section you can manage the customers who represent a group of buyers related to the same business organization: add a new customer and view, edit and delete existing customers, and access the aggregated information about customer users activities and eCommerce operations (requests for quotes, quotes, and sales orders).

You can also quickly get to the `customer organization structure </complete_reference/customers/customers/organize>`_, `address book </shared/common_actions/manage-address-book.html>`_ with a preview on the map, `customer users <Customer Users>`_, `price lists <Price Lists>`_ enabled for the customer, and overview of `requests for quote <Requests for quotes>`_, `sales orders <Orders>`_, `quotes <Quotes>`_ created by and for customer users. Finally, you can get to a summary of `activity <Summary of Activity>`_ from every operation triggered by the customer users.
