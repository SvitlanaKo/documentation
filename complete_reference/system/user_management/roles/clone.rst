Clone a Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create a role by cloning the existing one. For this, do as follows:

1. In the main menu, navigate **System>User Management>Roles**.

2. In the grid on the **All Roles** page, choose the required role, click the ellipsis menu at the right-hand end of the corresponding row and then click the |IcClone| **Clone** icon.

3. The **Create Role** page opens. It has all of the settings as the original role and 'Copy of \<original_role_name\>'  as its name. If required, modify settings as described in steps 3â€“6 of the `Create a Role <./access-management-roles-actions#create-a-role>`__ section.
