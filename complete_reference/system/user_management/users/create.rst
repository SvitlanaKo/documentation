Creating Account Users
======================

To create an account user, the seller-admin should navigate to the customer tab located in the top menu and click on “Account Users.” The first thing the seller will see are all the account users already entered into the system. He can easily edit these by selecting a specific record and clicking edit.

To create a new record, the seller should click on the blue button labelled “Create Account User.” The image below shows some of the fields the seller needs to fill out in order to create the account (fields can easily be added or deleted using configuration files), including which account this user will belong to, their password, their role, etc. If there are no roles are available yet, the seller can just save this record and come back when at least one role is available in the system.

Create a User Record
--------------------

In order to create a :term:`User` record:

- Go to *System → User Management → Users*
- Click the :guilabel:`Create User` button
- Define the user settings in the sections described below.


General
^^^^^^^

The "General" section defines the basic settings of the user created. The following fields are mandatory and **must** be 
defined in the section.

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Owner**","Define a :term:`business unit <Business Unit>`, users of which can manage the user, subject to the `role settings <../roles.html>`_."
  "**Status**","Chose the record status. Possible values are *Inactive* or *Active*."
  "**Username**","The name used to log into the system (login)."
  "**Password**","The password used to log into the system."
  "**First Name** and **Last Name**","Name used to refer to the user in the UI."
  "Primary Email","Email associated with the user in the system."
  
Along with the mandatory fields, there are a number of optional fields provided by default, that can be used to define 
additional details of the customer, such as the name prefix and suffix, the middle name, birthday, additional emails,
and phone number. You can also add the avatar (upload a picture to be used for the user in the UI) and/or 
:term:`tags <Tag>` related to the user.

The "*Send An Email Invitation*" check-box defines whether an invitation email must be sent to the user. The email 
content is defined in the course of the system integration and cannot be edited from the UI.

  mailbox
- Specify the login (user) and password used to access the mailbox
