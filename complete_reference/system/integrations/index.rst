Integrations: Third-Party Software and OroCommerce Embedded Forms
=================================================================

Intergations in OroCommerce fall into two groups:

* Integration with third-party software, like UPS and Google, that unlock additional capabilities (e.g. new shipping service options, single sign-on). 

* Integrating OroCommerce call-home code into the third-party web applications and websites.
