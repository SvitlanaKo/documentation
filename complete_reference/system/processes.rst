View Processes
--------------

To view the processes, navigate to the *System â†’ Processes* in the main menu.

The process list contains the following details:

  :header: "Name","Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "NAME","Defines the process available in the system." 
  "RELATED ENTITY","OroCRM :term:`entity`, records of which are influenced by the process."
  "EXECUTION ORDER","Priority of the process execution. The smaller is the number, the higher is the priority. If 
  several processes have been triggered simultaneously, the processes
  with a higher priority are executed first."
  "ENABLED","If set to *Yes*, the process will be executed."
  "CREATED AT","Date and time when the process was added to the system."
