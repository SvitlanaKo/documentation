#. Configure the following options:

     * **Locale**: defines the current system locale and is used to format date/time/datetime, numeric and percent values, monetary values and appropriate name formats.
     * **Primary Location**: usually refers to the current country and is used to define appropriate address formats and the default currency.
     * **Format address per country**: is a flag used to define whether or not an address should be formatted according to the rules of its country, or if the primary location of the application should be used instead;
     * **First Quarter Starts on**: defines the first day of the first quarter. This value is used to generate proper reports.
     * **Timezone**: defines which timezone should be used to render time and datetime values.
     * **Currency** specifies the system's currency in monetary fields.
     * The **Temperature Unit** and **Wind Speed Unit** are used to render additional information on location maps.

#. In the **Map Options**, select the **Temperature Unit** and **Wind Speed Unit** for display of the weather on the map. The default values are Fahrenheit and miles per hour (MPH).
