of an :term:`entity <Entity>` or on details of an `activity <actions.html>`_, other than a contact request 
(e.g. leave some additional details of task, comment on an email sent or a call made, etc.) use the "*Add Comment"* 
action.

.. note::

    Comments are available for any activity or entity that has the Comments activity 
    enabled in the `entity settings <../system/entities/entity.html>`_.
