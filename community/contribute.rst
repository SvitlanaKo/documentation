Contributing to Oro Source Code
===============================

We'd love for you to contribute to a free OroCommerce Community Edition open source code and related documentation. The following guidelines and recommendations help synchronize the community actions and provide a blueprint for seamless and non-intrusive collaboration.

Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------

The best way to contribute a bug fix or enhancement is to submit a `pull request`_ to the `OroCommerce on Github <http://github.com/orocommerce/>`_.

Before doing any changes to the code, please search GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. This will save your time and efforts on development of a duplicate solution.

Before submitting your source code changes in a pull request, please sign our `Contributor License Agreement`_ (CLA). The CLA must be signed for any code or documentation changes to be accepted.

Signing a Contributor License Agreement
---------------------------------------

Although signing the CLA is a prerequisite for accepting your pull request, you only need to do it once. So, if you've done this for any of our open source projects, you're good to go with all of them. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, our friendly *orocla* robot will automatically add a reminder to your pull request.
