Creating Roles
==============

To create a role, the seller will need to navigate to the customer tab located in the top menu and click on “Account User Roles.” In the image below, we’ve already created three different roles: Administrator, Buyer, and Role1. To begin the process of creating a new role, simply click on the blue button labelled “Create a New Role.” The form will then take the user through the necessary steps in a logical way.

Once the seller has entered in the name of the role and the accounts this role belongs to, he will go through the steps of assigning the action permissions and access levels for each entity (e.g., account, account user, account address, etc.) by clicking on the blue “None” link and allowing/disallowing access. Obviously, this entity list can be modified and other actions can be added or deleted using configuration files. In a similar way, the seller can assign capabilities and then assign account users to this role. (Note: This only works if account users were already created. If not, the seller should save the record and go back to it after the account users have been entered into the system).
