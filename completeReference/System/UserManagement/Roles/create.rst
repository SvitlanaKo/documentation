Creating Account Users
======================

To create an account user, the seller-admin should navigate to the customer tab located in the top menu and click on “Account Users.” The first thing the seller will see are all the account users already entered into the system. He can easily edit these by selecting a specific record and clicking edit.

To create a new record, the seller should click on the blue button labelled “Create Account User.” The image below shows some of the fields the seller needs to fill out in order to create the account (fields can easily be added or deleted using configuration files), including which account this user will belong to, their password, their role, etc. If there are no roles are available yet, the seller can just save this record and come back when at least one role is available in the system.
