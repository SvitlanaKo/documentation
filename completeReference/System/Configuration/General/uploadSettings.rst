Upload Settings
---------------

In the section you can define a set of mime types that will be supported for image and file entities and will be by 
default supported for attachments in the system. 

.. hint::

    If :ref:`attachments are enabled for an entity <user-guide-entity-management-create-attachments>`, the settings will 
    be applied only if that mime type list is empty.
