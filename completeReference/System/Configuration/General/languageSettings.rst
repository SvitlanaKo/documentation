Language Settings
-----------------


In *"System → Configuration → General setup → Language settings"* you can define a number of 
language-related options to be applied to the OroCRM instance, as follows:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Option", "Description", "Default"
  :widths: 15, 30, 10

  "**Default Language***","Defines the language used for the instance UI. Choose a language from the drop-down menu:
  
  |UseDef|","English"
  "**Supported Languages***","Defines a set of languages that can be used for translation of the 
  :ref:`email template <user-guide-email-template>`. Use the :guilabel:`Ctrl` and :guilabel:`Shift` keys to choose the 
  languages from the list.

  |Supported|","English"
  "**Available Translations** grid","

  - If the :guilabel:`Download` button is available and the *Translation status* column is empty, the
    translation has not been loaded by you. Click the :guilabel:`Download` button.

  - If the translation has been loaded and has an *Up to date* status, you can enable it (use the :guilabel:`Enable` 
    button).

  - If the translation has been loaded and enabled, you can Disable it (:guilabel:`Disable`).

  - The settings will be applied, once you have clicked the :guilabel:`Save Settings` button in the top right-hand 
    corner of the page. Enabled languages will appear in the *Supported Languages* field and in the *Default Language* 
    drop-down (unless *Use Default* is checked).
