In a B2B selling platform, tracking the sales progress and easy integration with the CRM system is a must have option. As OroCommerce is bundled with OroCRM, tracing the purchases of the company and company groups may be helpful for planning future sales and segmenting the existing ones.

In OroCommerce, customer is a group of buyers who represent the same business organization.
You can do the following:

* Register individual buyers as `customer users </user_guide/customer/customer-users.html>`_ and assign them `roles </user_guide/customer/customer-roles-and-permissions.html>`_ that define level of permissions and access to the actions and data in OroCommerce Front.

* `Assign price lists </user_guide/pricing/index.html>`_ that shall be visible to a customer buyers.

* Organize customers into `customer groups </user_guide/customer/customer-groups.html>`_ and share the price lists, payment and tax-related settings between several customers.

* View requests for quote, quotes, and orders made by customer users.

* Add notes and attachments to communicate information about the customer that is important for customer configuration.
