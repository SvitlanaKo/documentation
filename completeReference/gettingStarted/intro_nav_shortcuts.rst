Shortcuts
=========

.. warning:: Reused from OroCRM. Rework.

Shortcuts are used to quickly perform common actions from anywhere. They can also be used to create new records and to 
navigate through the system with ease. Shortcuts are particularly useful when you are not sure where an entity is in a 
menu.

Shortcuts are accessible via the icon in the navigation panel.

From here, you can:

- Launch an action from the "most used" list.

.. hint::

    This list is updated as you are using the system, and will initially contain the actions that you use the most.

- Start typing the name of a related entity or an action to choose from a list of matching items:

  |shortcut|
  
|

- To see all the available shortcut actions, click *"See the full list"* link.

  |shortcut_all|


All the :ref:`menu and sub-menu items <user-guide-navigation-menu>` and 
`Create forms <../../../completeReference/Advanced/dataManagement/form.html>`_ are available.
