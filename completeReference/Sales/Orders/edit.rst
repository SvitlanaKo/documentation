Editing an Order
================

The sales rep can find all the order information under Sales – Orders. This page includes all the orders submitted by a buyer and assigned to the sales rep. Selecting an order (for example,  FR1012402) will reveal more information about the order. Like responding to request for a quote, the sales rep will have to click on the “edit” button to respond.  The next page will show the order details like product quantities, taxes, processes, and a table that allows the sales rep to modify/update the order. Changing the order is done in the same manner as it was explained above. After this step is done, the sales rep can proceed by adding billing and shipping information in addition to estimate shipping costs on orders assigned to him and assign any type of discount he wishes. Once the sales rep completes the response, he can notify his buyer to let him know that the order is ready.
