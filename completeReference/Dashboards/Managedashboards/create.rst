Create a Dashboard
------------------

To create a dashboard:

- Go to the Dashboards section (in the Desktop UI it is signed with the icon |IcDashboard|) and select *"Manage 
  Dashboards"*.
  
- Click the :guilabel:`Create Dashboard` button in the top right corner of the grid.

- The *"Create Dashboard"* form will emerge.

The following fields are mandatory and **must** be specified:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Label**","Name used to refer to the dashboard in the system"
  "**Clone from**","Choose an existing dashboard to be used as a base for a new one. 
  
  This is convenient, if two dashboard don't differ much or if one of them is an extended version of another one (e.g.
  a dashboard sharpened for the aims of a usual sales manager and for the head of the sales department). 

  If you want to create the dashboard from the scratch, choose the option *Blank Dashboard*."
  "**Owner**","Limits the list of users that can manage the dashboard to the users,  whose 
  `roles <../../System/UserManagement/roles.html>`_ allow managing dashboards of the owner (e.g. the owner, 
  members of the same business unit, head of the department, etc.)."

To save the dashboard, click the button in the top right corner of the page. 

It has been added to the system.

Initially, the dashboard will contain all the widgets of the dashboard it has been cloned from. (Dashboards cloned 
from the Blank Dashboard will be empty).
