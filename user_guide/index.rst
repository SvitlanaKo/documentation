   #Starting a new B2B commerce project
   #-----------------------------------
   #
   #**WORK IN PROGRESS**
   #
   #You need a complete transparency of your services for your customers, easily controlled sales and marketing process for your employees, and access to statistics and retrospective data for leadership and management team. You might start with the following:
   #
   #* Request a demo (more info)
   #* Get a demo instance in Oro Cloud to try using OroCommerce without a hassle of complete configuration and setup. On your request, the demo instance may be installed with the demo data that reveals most of the functionality and provides the best learning experience for the new users.
   #* Make your mind about having an on-premise deployment vs OroCommerce in a Cloud. 
   #* Review a getting started section that explains basic configuration and data you'll need to start your B2B sells online.
   #* Plan your B2B Commerce rollover. Get more information about :ref:`using OroCommerce for Enterprize sales processes <orocommerce-user-guide-as-an-enterprise>` or about :ref:`using OroCommerce as a small and middle-size business owner <orocommerce-user-guide-as-a-business-owner>`).
