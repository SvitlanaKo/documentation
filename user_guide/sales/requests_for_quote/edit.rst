Editing Request for Quote
=========================

A sales rep can view all the quotes submitted by his assigned buyers by clicking on the “Quotes” sub menu under the Sales menu. In this screen, the sales rep can view all the information about the quotes including owners, date created, PO number, etc. The rep can easily start responding by clicking on a quote request. In this example, quote request #13 is submitted by one of his buyers, Marlene Bradley. Clicking on the quote will navigate the sales rep to the quote details page where he can view all the products requested, their quantities, requested price, etc. To view more details and respond, the sales person should click on the “edit” button on the upper left.

On the following page, the sales rep can see quantities per order, the related price submitted by his buyer and additional information such as shipping date requirements, customer notes, etc. Now the sales rep can create a proposal and respond to each line item in the quote request. He can change the quantity per the offered prices, set conditions (i.e. offering the price per unit for an order with a minimum quantity), and adjust the price per unit by selecting on the list icon located between the “Unit” and the “Price” fields. The sales rep can offer various price lists/product prices depending on the customer, order quantity, or personal discretion (limited by his role and access level). The sales rep can also delete items, offer additional products, and add product/services that are not included in the catalog such as the cost of assembly, etc. Once he completes this section, the sales rep can then proceed to enter shipping information and notify the customer that his proposal is ready.
