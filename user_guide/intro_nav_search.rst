Search
======

Search is the fastest way to find a specific record you need. To find a record in OroCRM:

# Click the search icon in the top of the screen – |IcSearch|
# Type in the search key the text field
# Click Go or hit Enter on the keyboard


For example, we are searching for "Ann" all over the system:

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/panel/search_ex_1.png

|


These are our search results:

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/panel/search_ex_2.png

|

The search returned 28 records, 2 of which are Accounts, 2 – Contacts, 6 are Magento Shopping Carts, etc. You can scroll 
through the entire list of results or select a specific entity in order to find the desired record faster.

If you wait for a few second before clicking Go, you will see a dropdown list of most relevant results. If the one you 
are looking for is in the list, click it to open straight away. Here are the most relevant results for the example 
above:

Modify the Search
-----------------

To save time, you can limit the search by a certain entity straight away. For example, if you know you’re looking for 
an account, you can look for "Ann" in Accounts only.

In order to see all the records with a specific tag anywhere in the system.

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/panel/search_vip.png

You will see the page similar to the search results, that will contain all the records with this tag.
