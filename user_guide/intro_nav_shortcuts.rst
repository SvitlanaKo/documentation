Shortcuts
=========

Shortcuts are used to perform common actions quickly from anywhere. They can be, particularly, used to create new 
records and navigate through the system quickly. Shortcuts are at hand, if you are not sure where in the menu the entity 
youâ€™re looking for is.

Shortcuts are accessible via the icon in the navigation panel.

    This list is updated as you are using the system, and will initially contain the actions that you use the most.

* Start typing the name of a related entity or an action to choose from a list of matching items:
