Buyer's Guide

Using a Shopping list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our vast experience in implementing B2B ecommerce platform drove us to introduce in OroCommerce the new concept of a shopping list. The way it came to be is that we saw that within the same company buyers are working on multiple shopping lists at the same time. These buyers were working on different projects that needed different products such as trade show displays and/or printed material, product or equipment for different business units within the organization, etc.. We found they did not have the appropriate tools to manage this process. In many cases, the eCommerce application they used did not allow them to create and manage multiple shopping lists. This limitation drove the buyers to manage the process outside their eCommerce application using email threads, excel documents and even on paper which is inefficient, time consuming and costly. The struggle buyers are currently facing is the driving force behind the concept of shopping lists in OroCommerce. Now with OroCommerce, you can create and manage all your shopping lists and go through the purchasing process with efficiency and ease.
Creating a Shopping list

As we mentioned in previous blogs, when a buyer logs in to the seller’s store front, he will see the catalog(s) and price list(s) customized specifically for him. The buyer can select to view the catalog in a way that makes it easier for him to start the purchasing process including images with short description, Sku # and price (tile view), to images list view with detailed information (list view) or juts a product list with basic product information and no images (text view).

Creating a new shopping list is easy and straight forward where a buyer can create a new list via two flows. First, locate the shopping list button on the upper right corner with the list logo next to it, select create new shopping list, give the list a name and save it. The second flow is to click on the drop down icon located in the black “Add to” button next to each product, select create a new shopping list, give it a name and save. Now the buyer can add any products and product quantities to any of his lists and either create an order or requests a quote using the obvious orange below the list. Once a quote or an order were created the buyer will receive confirmations with all the pertaining information. In addition, the seller will receive a notification that a new order or a quote request was created by one of his customers and now waiting for a response/proposal

Submit a Quick Order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The buyer can also use the quick order form in cases he needs to submit an order quickly and he has all the information needed to do so available. To start the process of creating a quick order form, the buyer should click on the quick order form link with the lightning symbol next to it located in the upper right corner. Once the buyer clicks on the link, he will see a carefully designed form that includes all the items a buyer would need to submit a detailed order form in the most intuitive and easy way.

In the item # list, the buyer either can enter a product sku# or can use the auto complete search function to enter the desired products. The buyer can add as many products by adding additional product rows using the link just under the last item number and obviously add the wanted quantity for each of the products. The buyer can also paste the order from another document and email to the box located just right to the order form or even import an Excel or csv file containing the order information. Once this is done, the buyer can verify the order and do one of three things: add the quick order to an existing list, create an order or request a quote. As mentioned in the previous section the buyer will receive a confirmation and the seller will notify that he needs to respond to a customer request

Managing your organization account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OroCommerce lets the seller set up different corporate account hierarchies and structures. Each structure is delegated to the front-end of the application enabling the buyer to set his/her exact company account structure, regardless of its complexity.

As important as the corporate account setup is, however, completely controlling and managing the selling and buying processes also means that users must be assigned the appropriate account user and role. The account user, role and permissions provide users with access to data and the ability to perform tasks based on their business responsibilities and the company guidelines.  The ability to do this is crucial for both the buyer and the seller, as it helps support the various operations of their businesses. OroCommerce comes out of the box with the capabilities to allow buyers and sellers to specify the exact roles and permissions each account user requires in order to do their job as efficiently as possible, eliminate mistakes and save money.

Create Account Users
********************

Account users can be created in two ways. For instance, a buyer-user can log into the system via the front-end, and the system will then immediately assign a default Customer Group and an Account. Alternatively, a buyer-admin can initiate the process. In both cases, the buyer-admin will have to complete the process in his admin panel.

To create an account user, the buyer-admin (in this case, Amanda Cole from Company A) will click on the “My Account” link located in the top navigation bar and choose Account Users. She will then see all the other account users under her management who are already in the system (in this example, they are Brenda and Lois).

To create a new account user, Amanda will need to click on the black button labelled “Create Account” and complete the form you see below. This includes entering in any personal information and a password, as well as assigning them a role from a predefined list (created for her by the seller-admin).

Creating Roles
**************

Like the seller-admin, the buyer-admin (Amanda) can create new roles and/or modify existing roles. To create a new role, Amanda will need to choose “Account User Roles” and then click on the black button labelled “Create New User Role.” We’ve designed the form to be simple and intuitive so that buyer-admins can quickly go through it. While Amanda will need to enter in lots of information and assign access levels to different entities and capabilities, this will all provide her with the flexibility she needs to set the exact accounts and roles she needs for her company.

In this phase, it’s important to note that she will also need to determine which addresses this role and the account users assigned to this role can use for shipping or billing, which address books are allowed, audit account history , etc. The last step is to assign account users to the appropriate role.
